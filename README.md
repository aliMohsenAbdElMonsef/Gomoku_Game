# Gomoku Game Solver 🎮🧠

An AI-powered Gomoku (Five in a Row) game implemented in Python. This project features both **Human vs AI** and **AI vs AI** modes using classical game theory algorithms: **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.

---

## 📌 Game Overview

**Gomoku** is a strategic board game where two players take turns placing stones on a grid. The first to align five stones in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. This solver simulates AI logic to determine the best moves and supports different board sizes.
